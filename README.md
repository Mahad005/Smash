          <article><h2>Super Smash Bros. Summary</h2>
              <p>Super Smash Bros. is a 4-player fighting game where you play as multiple Ninendo characters & try to knock the opponent out of the screen. You have over 70 characters to choose from and a huge variaty of stages to fight on.
              It changed the definition of fighting games as we know it. And every iteration has been featured in tons of fighting game tournaments. Every iteration brings something new to the table, wether it be new characters, new stages, new items, etc.
              Every Smash Bros. game is something new to offer & it's one of the most fun multiplayer games out there.</p>
            <h1>Story</h1>
              <p>The series doesn't have that much story in it. But in every game, there is a mode called "Classic Mode" where you fight multiple characters in different stages, with a few minigames in between & in the end, you fight a giant glove. It's dumb, but it's really fun & it's what we got for a story.</p>
            <h1>Gameplay</h1>
              <p>The series is a unique kind of fighting game. In most fighting games, you fight the opponent until their heath bar drops to zero. In Super Smash Bros., you try to knock your opponent of the stage using different attacks or using items you find on the ground.
              You have the choice of multiple characters throughout Nintendo's history to play as, including a few characters from different companies. </p>
